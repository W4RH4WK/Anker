# Anker

Anker is a **work-in-progress** prototype implementation for a 2D metroidvania-style game.

The engine code is a fork of an internal research project named [*Ikaros*](https://ph3at.github.io/posts/CPP-Static-Reflection-1/).
Various open-source libraries are used, most notably:

- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- [refl-cpp](https://github.com/veselink1/refl-cpp)
- [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/)
- [Box2D](https://box2d.org/)
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/)
